<h3>Multimodal</h3>

<p>
    Those who like all four modes equally well have difficulty 
choosing because they want a little of everything. Other 
multimodalhave some certain “taste” and dislikes because they are 
bimodal or trimodal. </p>
<p>
The bi-modals, are little different from those with a single V, 
A, R or K preference,although there is a wide diversity within this 
group some. At the other end of the spectrum are those students who 
have equal preferences among all four modes. With a balanced set of 
preferences they prefer information coming in a wide variety of the 
four modes. They may arrange to the different teaching styles faced in 
a day or they may opt in and out of alternative strategies; being Visual 
in Economics and Read/write in Philosophy. As soon as more than 
one mode is preferred choice comes (Fleming, 2012:73).</p>
<h5>Their Characteristics</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Those who have multimodal approach learning and decision 
            making in two different ways. Some commit like people with a 
            single preference except that they have four single preferences. 
            They look at the information that has to be studied and choose the 
            mode that they believe is the best one for each situation. For 
            instance if they have to learn a physical skill they will utilize their 
            kinesthetic preference to work with it, to try it and to become 
            practical. They will use their read/write preference,if they have to 
            learn about an important legal contract. This group changes from 
            mode to mode and they have the flexibility to accustome to a 
            number of different modes both incoming and outgoing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        A number of their modes in combination to make decisions and to 
        learn and present materials to others are used this multimodal
        category. They are uncertain about any learning that arrives in 
        only one way and they want to support it by adding other modes 
        of input or output. For instance they may obtain some of the ideas 
        from the teacher’s oral explanations, and some from discussing 
        and questioning their colleagues. They may add to this by using 
        the textbook or by thinking about some practical applications of 
        the new idea they have studied. They may also utilize their visual 
        preference to draw some form of schematic diagram of the 
        material to be studied. Together these choices utilize V, A, R and 
        K. Only then are they satisfied that they really comprehend
        something. Some people may review them for taking a long time 
        to learn or make a decision. That is because they are being careful 
        and aqcuiring a wider view before acting(Fleming, 2012:73).

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Because they have to gather in all four modes to really 
    understand something fully, this group takes longer to become 
    confident about their learning. The payback is that, when they do so, 
    their understanding of their new learning is more versatile and more 
    definite than those with only a single preference. This is an advantage 
    because they will have a deeper/wider understanding of it if they have 
    to express or teach their learning to others. The disadvantage that this 
    group has is that they often half-learn new material and it is not fully 
    understood, because they may not be able to gather in the many ways 
    that would be satisfying. If their teacher or colleague uses only one 
    mode to explain something – say Read/write (a teacher who uses a 
    text book all the time) - they may have difficulty learning best in that 
    subject. Another clue to multimodality exists in the order in which 
    they obtain information. Some say that they always start with 
    something written or maybe they begin by trying it before ask for 
    helping from others. This may find that within their VARK 
    multimodality there is a primary mode and that they use the other 
    modes only as support.

<p>
    Imagine someone that V, A, R and K scores are the same. If 
    they wanted to study about the new release of a product or service, 
    because they are multimodal, they would not be satisfied until they 
    had:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Seen a specified diagram of how it works, and</li>
    <li>Listen about it from a friend or authority that they believe in, and</li>
    <li>Read something about it, and</li>
    <li>Tried it themselves (Fleming, 2012: 73-75)</li>
