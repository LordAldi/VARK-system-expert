<h3>Visual</h3>
<p>
    This preference consists of the description of information in 
charts, graphs, flow charts, and all the symbolic arrows, circles, 
21
hierarchies and other devices that teachers use to represent what might 
have been presented in words. Layout, whitespace, headings, patterns, 
designs and color are necessary in establishing meaning(Fleming, 
2012:1).
Those with a visual preference would prefer that a book, a 
lesson, an article are presented in a series of diagrams, charts and 
drawings because that is how they learn best. Those are some visual 
strategies in learning:
1) INTAKE (To take in information)
Learners who have a strong preference for the Visual (V) 
mode should use some or all of the following.
a) Maps
b) Charts
c) Graphs
d) Symbols
e) Diagrams
f) Brochures
g) Underlining
h) Flow charts
i) Highlighters
j) Different colors
k) Textbooks with diagrams
l) The layout and design of posters, slides...
22
m) Word pictures
n) Different spatial arrangements on the page (like this list)
o) Listening to teachers who use gestures and picturesque 
language.
p) Whitespace- making the blank areas around text and 
diagrams more significant.
2) SWOT (Study without tears)
To make a learnable package they need to reduce their 
‘notes’ by making them into distinctive ‘page pictures’. They 
should:
a) Turn tables into graphs.
b) Draw pictures to show their ideas.
c) Read the words and convert them into diagrams.
d) Make complex processes and lists into flowcharts.
e) Redraw their newly designed pages from memory.
f) Replace the words with symbols, pictures or initials.
g) Look at their pages for meanings. Remember the shape, 
format and color.
h) Reconstruct the images in different ways - try different 
spatial arrangements.
i) Use all the techniques above to make each study page look 
different.
3) OUTPUT
23
To perform well in examinations they should:
a) Practice turning their Visuals back into words.
b) Practice writing exam answers- there are few Visual tests in 
higher education.
c) Recall the “pictures” made in the study pages.
d) Draw things.
e) Use diagrams to answer the questions(Fleming, 2012:51-52).
