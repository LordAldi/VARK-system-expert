<h3>Read/Write</h3>
<p>
    This preference is for information exhibited as words either 
read or written. These learners place importance on the accuracy in 
language and are keen to use quotes, lists, texts, books and manuals. 
They have a strong reverence for words(Fleming, 2012:1).
Those with this preference would prefer that a book, a lesson, 
a text is dense with text and unadorned with fancy fonts and diagrams. </p>
<p>
Those are some read/write strategies in learning:

        <h6>INTAKE (To take in the information)</h6>
        <p>Learners who have a strong preference for Reading and Writing (R) should use some or all of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Lists.</li>
            <li>Notes.</li>
            <li>Essays.</li>

            <li>Contracts.</li>
            <li>Textbooks.</li>
            <li>Glossaries.</li>
            <li>Definitions.</li>
            <li>Quotations.</li>

            <li>Computer and other mechanical manuals.</li>
            <li>Listening to teachers who use words well and who have lots of information in sentences and notes.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>SWOT (Study without tears)</h6>
        <p>
            To make a learnable package they need to reduce their “notes” by using these reading and writing techniques.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write out the words again and again.</li>
            <li>Read their notes (silently) again and again.</li>
            <li>Do the “extra” reading requested by the teacher.</li>
            <li>Rewrite the ideas and principles into other words.</li>
            <li>Organize any diagrams, graphs … into statements e.g. “The trend is…”</li>
            <li>Use a word-processor to arrange their ideas and to “play” with words.</li>
            <li>Turn reactions, actions, diagrams, links, charts and flow diagrams into words.</li>
            <li>Imagine lists arranged in multiple-choice questions and distinguish between them.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>OUTPUT</h6>
        <p>
            To perform well in examinations they should:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write exam answers.</li>
            <li>Write practice paragraphs.</li>
            <li>Re-order their lists into priority order.</li>
            <li>Refer to publications – citing references.</li>
            <li>Practice with multiple-choice questions.</li>
            <li>Organize written beginnings and endings.</li>
            <li>Use their word-processor to prepare answers.</li>
            <li>Write their notes into lists (a, b, c , d, 1, 2, 3, 4,).</li>
            <li>Arrange their words into hierarchies and bullet points.</li>
            <li>Search the Internet for new ideas and confirmation of old ones (Fleming, 2012:64)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
